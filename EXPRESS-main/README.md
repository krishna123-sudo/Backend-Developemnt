- Note that all routes are protected, you need to send an Authorization header with a valid JWT token using tools like Postman.
- To upload a JSON file , you need to send it through form-data under key "file" using a tool like Postman.
- Please follow the below example format to upload the movie and actor files. 
    - Example movies upload file :
        >
        ```json
        {
        "movies":[
            {"title":"The Shawshank Redemption 6", "year":1994, "rating":9.3},
            {"title":"The Godfather", "year" : 1972, "rating":9.2},
            {"title":"The Godfather 7", "year" : 1980, "rating":9.3}
            ]
        }
    - Example actors upload file :
        >
        ```json
        {
            "actors":[
                {
                    "name": "Avinash",
                    "age": 32,
                    "gender":"Male"
                },
                {
                    "name":"Krishna",
                    "age": 45,
                    "gender":"Male"
                }
            ]
        }

**Using the GraphQL endpoint**

1. Authentication:

- Obtain an authorization token through authentication system(login).
- Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests to authenticate with the GraphQL endpoint.

2. Send Queries:

- Construct your GraphQL query using the GraphQL query language.
- Use your GraphQL client (Apollo) to send the query to the GraphQL endpoint.
- Ensure the query is properly formatted and includes all required fields.
    > Example:
    ```graphql
        query {
        getMovies {
            title
            year
            rating
        }
    }
3. Send Mutations :

- Construct your GraphQL mutation using the GraphQL query language.
- Use your GraphQL client to send the mutation to the GraphQL endpoint.
- Ensure the mutation is properly formatted and includes all required input fields.
    > Example:
    ```graphql
        mutation {
        createUser(input: {username: "John", password: "password", role: "actor"}) {
            id
            name
            email
        }
    }
